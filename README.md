# HCI-NTUA

### Are you in a desperate search to find a mate for your rare Chinchilla pet, but despite the time and effort you have wasted you have not found one yet?

## The waiting is over!

Peetings is an Android mobile app developed by me for the lesson of Human Computer Interface of NTUA.
It is centered around the mating of pets, mainly exotic ones.
Within the application you can find a mate for your pet, no matter how rare it is.
Additionally Pet owners from all around the world can have converstations over the habits of their pets, their appetite preferences, good nearby vets, and more interesting subjects about their small (or big) companions.

In order to have a look for yourself you can download the demo apk from this repository.

Due to it being public, there are deliberately files missing from this repository, if you want to get the rest of the files or more information about this project you can contact me on kostastsaousis99@gmail.com
